Stock Breakout Watchlist
This Python project identifies potential stock breakouts from the S&P 500 list based on a combination of price and volume criteria. It uses the Yahoo Finance API to download stock data and generates a watchlist for stocks that meet the defined criteria.

Features
Downloads stock data for the past 3 months (with daily intervals).
Calculates a 50-day moving average (50_MA) for each stock.
Calculates the 10-day average volume (10_AVG_VOL).
Identifies stocks where:
The stock price is above its 50-day moving average.
The trading volume is at least 50% higher than the 10-day average volume.
Outputs a list of stocks meeting the criteria, displaying:
Ticker
Current Price
Trading Volume
50-Day Moving Average (50_MA)
Requirements
Python 3.x
yfinance library (for downloading stock data)
pandas library (for data manipulation)
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install yfinance pandas
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that all required libraries are installed.
Modify the sp500 list with the stock tickers you want to analyze, or use the default list of S&P 500 companies.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python stock_breakout_watchlist.py
The script will print out a list of stocks meeting the breakout criteria (price above the 50-day moving average and volume 50% higher than the 10-day average).

Example Output:
yaml
Copy code
Processing AAPL...
Processing MSFT...
Processing GOOGL...

Customization
You can modify the list of stock tickers in the sp500 variable. Currently, it contains a list of S&P 500 companies. You can replace it with a custom list of tickers you want to analyze.

50_MA: Change the rolling window for the moving average calculation (currently set to 50 days).
Volume: Adjust the percentage multiplier for the volume (currently set to 1.5 for 50% higher).
